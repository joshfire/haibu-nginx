nginx configuration generator for haibu
---------------------------------------

If haibu-balancer doesn't cut it for you, you may want to use a powerful reverse proxy like nginx.

This module will read a haibu status (often at http://127.0.0.1:9002/drones) and create a nginx-upstream.conf
file that you can use in your existing nginx configuration.

TODO: make a service which hooks to haibu-server events and update the config real-time. (w/ hook.io it seems)

config.js should be self-explanatory.


Install
-------

# npm install haibu-nginx -g


Usage
-----

$ haibu-nginx config.js

Then include the generated haibu-upstream.conf in your nginx config. 

You may also want to include haibu-reverseproxy.conf if your config is very simple but I expect 
people to want to use their own custom settings for the server {} section (caches, ...) 


Websockets?
-----------

If you need websocket support, you currently need a custom nginx build:
